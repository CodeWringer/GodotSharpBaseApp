1. An input validation framework - keep scrolling to see examples.
2. A data serialization framework, using the NuGet dependency \"UTF8Json\". 
3. Three undo systems: command, memento/snapshot and delta pattern. 
4. The Roboto font from Google Fonts - all credit goes to their respective owners. 

To get started, make it your own:
1. Change out the `app/icon.png` image for your own. 
2. Change the name of the project to your own. For that, in Godot, navigate to `Project > Project Settings > Application > config` and change the name to your preference. Be mindful that changing the name affects several other things in Godot, such as the name of the user-specific data directory. 
3. If you're working with Visual Studio, the solution file can be found in `app` and is called `app.sln`. 
4. Write your model of business data, inside the `app/business/model` directory and integrate your model into the `app/business/state/ApplicationState.cs` class. 
5. Define the application-level settings as fields inside the `app/business/state/ApplicationSettings.cs` class. 
6. Delete the `app/views/demo` directory and its contents, as those views are not meant to ever reach production. They are provided with this project as demonstrations of the features that come with the project. "
